                <p>Nothing like a good build at 2am in the morning, right? This model was built for Bricknerd's Festival of Mundanity contest, where builders were challenged to create the most ordinary, mundane builds. I initially had no intent on entering, but that all changed when I had the unexpected shower thought that the <a href="" target="_blank">galidor shield</a> really resembled the dispenser of a pump bottle.</p>
                <p>I quickly got to work making a bottle with <a href="" target="_blank">balloon panels</a> and the MOC was pretty much finished. Noticing the amount of empty space within the panel assembly, I decided to then try and add in an imitation pumping feature - and this is the time sink that resulted in a very, very late night.</p>
                <p>I went through my container of shock absorbers and decided to use the <a href="" target="_blank">Ducati shock absorber</a>, due to its spring stiffness being the perfect strength you'd expect from pushing on an actual bottle. However, this piece is unique compared to the more traditional Technic <a href="" target="_blank">shock absorbers</a> in that the length is 11L compared to 6.5L. This posed a more difficult challenge as the balloon panels are also 11L long, which limited the amount of space available to fit the shock absorber. I ended up creating a very compact assembly, where there are loose Technic axles restricted to one degree of freedom such that everything moves with the spring as seen below.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>For the cap of the bottle, none of the parts are physically connected to the bottle, they just rest there. This is necessary as any axle connection on the shaft would create friction and make the feature inoperable. Lastly, a rubber band was added to the top of the panels as reinforcement, as the bar connections up there are very weak.</p>
                <p>Though I stayed up way too late for what was essentially a joke MOC, I ended up really utilizing a lot of Technic skills on this. I also ended up winning the contest with this build, which was very rewarding considering the time spent.</p>

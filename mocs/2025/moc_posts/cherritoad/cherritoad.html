                    <p>I guess better late than never. This MOC was built for the themed build month "Frogust" (and actually completed in August), but I haven't had the time to publish it until now. So I'll let you decide if this counts as the last frog for 2025 or the first for 2026.</p>
                    <p>I didn't quite have a clear vision of what I wanted to build until about halfway through, so the frog design process was very fluid. I started with the eyes. There were two designs I was bouncing around: narrow pupils and wide pupils. Narrow pupils would lead to a more realistic and serious design, while wide, round pupils would lend itself to a more cartoon/cute design. I knew I wanted to play with some brighter colors, so I decided to go with the wider pupils to work in a more fantastical theming.</p>
                    <p>After building the frog's head, I started work on the body. However, I had some curved bars lying around and when placed on the head, it looked like a cherry. Food creatures are always fun to build, so I decided to lean into it and turn the frog into a cherry. I added the tiny arms, but needed a single piece that would capture the hands and fingers, which was achieved with the splat tile. The only problem was that this piece only came in a few colors. The pink variant of this piece gave me the idea to make the frog sit on an icecream swirl, and there just so happened to be a new member of the macaroni family to make this happen. I had been waiting so long for the opportunity to spam these. After weaving the noodles into a swirl, I used some tiles on clips to create the waffle cone.</p>
                    <p>This was a very fun build and an impromptu addition to my food creature gallery. Getting to spam the new noodles was definitely the highlight for me.</p>

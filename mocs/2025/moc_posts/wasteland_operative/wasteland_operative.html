                    <p>This week was challenging. I didn't feel particularly inspired by the theme ("Trash"), so I ended up building a humanoid (dude build) with some salvagepunk inspiration. Hopefully this isn't too much of a stretch for the theme!</p>
                    <p>I originally wanted to make a hazmat suit for the character, so I started with the gas mask. It uses two minifigure <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=30152c02&name=Minifigure,%20Utensil%20Magnifying%20Glass%20with%20Trans-Red%20Lens%20(Alpha%20Team)&category=%5BMinifigure,%20Utensil%5D#T=S&C=11&O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">magnifying glass</a> pieces for the goggles. I needed a way to hide the bar connections of these parts, and while I had initially wanted to make a hood to cover over the mask, I ended up making a hat as it was less parts intensive. With this development and realizing that if I were to make the hazmat suit for the torso, it would take up too many parts, I decided to switch to the salvagepunk aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>For the torso, I used a single <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=41144&name=Galidor%20Torso%20Jens&category=%5BGalidor%5D#T=S&C=10&O={%22color%22:10,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Galidor piece</a>. I really liked the way the metal, upper portion of the part looked; however, I needed a way to hide the lower portion as there would be no way to make the leg connections proportionally correct. Using some <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=37596&idColor=11#T=P&C=11" target="_blank">Star Wars cloth</a> and a belt, I was able to hide off the lower part of the torso, and "fill" the waist area.</p>
                    <p>Struggling to stay at/under the 101 part limit, I made asymmetrical arms for the character. The left arm would be more visible, so I put in more detail and parts into it. Since the right arm was further back, I decided to use a <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=79846&idColor=85#T=S&C=85&O={%22color%22:85,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">SCCBS joint</a> (from Ninjago), which freed up some parts.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I made a two piece base using a <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=44331cx1&idColor=81#T=S&C=81&O={%22color%22:81,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Duplo part</a> from the Little Robots tree and the metal portion of <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=43484#T=S&C=28&O={%22color%22:28,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Nick Bluetooth's head</a>. The Duplo base was obtained by removing the screws from the tree. I included the base to give a bit more context to the character. Particularly, the metal scrap Galidor piece is intended to further cement the salvager concept.</p>
                    <p>Though this week's theme was tough, I like how this build turned out. Something I've been enjoying throughout the Rogue Olympics contest is trying to make builds that, at a glance, don't look like 101 parts, and I feel like this one fits that ethos.</p>

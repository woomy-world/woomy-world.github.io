                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>While in Denmark, I picked up one of the best elements ever produced by Lego: a plush <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=pri071&idColor=3#T=S&C=3&O={%22color%22:3,%22iconly%22:0}" target=_blank>chicken head</a>. Of course, this element doesn't have any connections, but when has that ever been a problem? With this still being a Rogue Olympics build, the 101 part limit still applies. Therefore, with the chicken head as the main inspiration piece, I decided to go big and utilize larger elements this week.</p>
                    <p>Working at a larger scale with a part limit posed an interesting challenge. While these parts cover a lot of space, most of the part allocation ended up going into the internals to hold up these large pieces. The shell - an <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?G=UpscaledHelmet#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">upscaled hard hat</a> - was connected by creating a Technic structure to fit around the circumference of the piece. I ended up going through a few iterations to optimize and reduce the amount of parts in the frame.</p>
                    <p>The final count was 96 pieces. It is a little unfinished on the camera unfriendly side in order to stay under the part limit (and I didn't have enough parts to finish the last few legs). I've been enjoying this sort of "small" build every week, so I guess we'll see what next week offers!</p>

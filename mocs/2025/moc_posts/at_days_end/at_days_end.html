                    <p>Having heard some chatter about Rogue Olympics and seeing as some of my current WIPs are in PAB limbo, I decided to jump in and take a crack at this contest - subsequently signing myself up for 8 weeks of non-stop building. Furthermore, the 101 part limit piqued my interest as I have quite a few weird parts that might finally see the light of day.</p>
                    <p>The theme for this first round was "twilight". With this theme, I wanted to do some silhouette work similar to the <a href="https://i.redd.it/56i1r2nbui271.png" target="_blank">loading screens</a> from Donkey Kong games. This art typically features a gradient where objects in the background have color but progressively become darker as one moves to the foreground. So, I began the build with the foreground layer. I wanted some sort of character or creature rather than only scenery, and after messing with some <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2715#T=S&C=11&O={%22color%22:%2211%22,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Technic helmets</a> and other minifig accessories, I ended up with a cat. Because I had chosen this creature, I decided to go with an urban environment. Working my way toward the background, I decided to go with dark brown followed by dark red for the buildings. In particular, the dark brown helped bridge the gap between the black of the foreground and eventual red hues used for the sun. I needed something a bit lighter behind the buildings to bring out the cat silhouette, so I chose magenta as the sky layer. Lastly, I went with red, reddish-orange, and orange for the dishes in the sun assembly. This combination was interesting as the reddish-orange when paired with red seemed to tone down red's intensity, and the orange dish appeared a lot brighter when paired up with reddish-orange.</p>
                    <p>I ended up using 98 pieces for this build. Not sure if I'll be building for all 8 weeks... Come back next week to see if I post something new!</p>

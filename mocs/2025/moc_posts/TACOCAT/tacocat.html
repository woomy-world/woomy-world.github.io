                    <p>For this week's Rogue Olympics build, I seem to have ventured further into uncanny creature building. With the theme of "Backwards", my first thought was to do something palindrome related, and the taco cat felt like something I could adapt into Lego.</p>
                    <p>I decided to go with a design where the cat face is part of the taco shell rather than just a cat in a taco costume. With the ever-looming 101 piece count, I figured this design would allow me to stay within that limit as I wouldn't have to make a fully 3D head and limbs. However, with this wacky design, I needed to make sure to include details that would allow the cat to be easily parsed. Thus, a majority of the part count went towards crafting the face. The inclusion of paws and a tail helped to further bring out the cat DNA in this model.</p>
                    <p>As I had used a majority of parts in the cat face, I had to use some larger parts to fill out the taco. In particular, various <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/search.page?q=foam%20scala%20bush#T=P" target="_blank">scala foam</a> was used for the lettuce as these parts provided a lot of visual space. The taco beef uses minifigure hair pieces as their finer texturing matched that ground beef texture.</p>
                    <p>I'm a bit surprised I was able to pull this one off with the piece limit and without as many larger parts compared to last week. Of course, it still only looks good from one angle, but it is pretty neat to see what can still be done with an imposed part limit. Come back next week to see if I continue to go down the uncanny creature rabbit hole.</p>

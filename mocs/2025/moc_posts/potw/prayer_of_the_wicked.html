                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>I knew it would happen at some point - a one day build. I was pretty busy all week, and of the little time I did have to build, I could not get anything going. So of course, the day before this week's build is due, I finally was able to lock in and make something.</p>
                    <p>While I wasn't building, I had been thinking about what to make for this week's theme: "wish". I had narrowed down what I wanted to build to either a djinn or something prayer/cleric related. Going with the fantasy cleric route, I started with the head assembly. The pearl dark gray (PDG) <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=20475&idColor=77#T=S&C=77&O={%22color%22:77,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">skeleton armor</a> used for the head has not only an ornate texture but also a distinct, ominous shape. I decided to build on this shape language by adding the minifig spear combined with an <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=5689&idColor=77#T=S&C=77&O={%22color%22:77,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">axe head</a>.</p>
                    <p>Moving to the torso, I had two textures to keep track of: the PDG textures established by the head and the outer robe layer. I continued the PDG textures by utilizing the central portion of CCBS <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=20473&idColor=51#T=S&C=77&O={%22color%22:%2277%22,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">skeleton shells</a>. The sharp layering texture provided by this part matched the layering I had set up with the skeleton armor and minifig weapons in the head design. Next, I used some Star Wars CCBS shells and Galidor shields to create the robe. All of these parts have rounder edges, which help them blend together and separate them from the PDG texture.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=42850&name=Galidor%20Accessory%20Staff%20Euripides&category=%5BGalidor%5D#T=S&C=17&O={%22color%22:17,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Galidor staff</a> was something I wanted to include from the start since it felt like the perfect cleric accessory. As for the other arm, I decided to use barbs for the fingers to add a bit more to the ominous nature of this character. A <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=11010&name=Minifigure,%20Utensil%20Ring%201%20x%201&category=%5BMinifigure,%20Utensil%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">chrome ring</a> was added as a bracelet to draw attention to this detail and break up the black.</p>
                    <p>For the composition, I added some flame/magic effects using the recent <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=5435&name=Power%20Burst,%20Curved%20with%20Dragon%20Head%20and%20Spines&category=%5BEnergy%20Effect%5D#T=S&C=50&O={%22color%22:%2250%22,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Ninjago spinners</a>. I had a few tablescraps with these pieces lying around, so I decided to use it here as they are relatively large parts - perfect for taking up space and staying under the part limit. Lastly, I used a minifigure (I know, shocker) to complete the "prayer" theme.</p>

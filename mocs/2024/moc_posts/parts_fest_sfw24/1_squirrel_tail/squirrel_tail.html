                    <p><i>This MOC is part of a series of MOCs built for New Elementary. A more in-depth analysis of the seed part used in this MOC can be found <a href="https://www.newelementary.com/2024/12/after-party-fest-nathan-dons-mocs.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</i></p>

                    <p>While in Denmark, I had the opportunity to participate in one of New Elementary’s workshops, and ended up joining in on their Skærbæk Parts Festival. While the blog article linked above focuses on the seed parts, I’d like to go through a bit of the composition involved with this MOC.</p>

                    <p>After deciding that the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=5386&name=Minifigure%20Costume%20Tail%20Squirrel&category=%5BMinifigure,%20Body%20Wear%5D#T=S&C=2&O={%22color%22:2,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">squirrel tail</a> would make the perfect turtle head, I began thinking of the colors I wanted to use. I knew I wanted to use the large figure shell as a turtle shell, which conveniently came in regular green. With the turtle colors settled, I then needed to find colors for the scenery that would complement but not distract from the turtle. Since sea turtles typically live in warm, tropical waters, I decided to reflect that by choosing warmer pastel colors. In particular, the circular base uses medium nougat and dark pink seaweed further helps to lighten the nougat color. Then, I went about adding a rock piece to contrast the plant-life. I decided to go with dark bluish gray to ensure the base wasn’t too bright because I still wanted the turtle to be the focal point. To further guide the viewer upward, a second seaweed piece is placed slightly higher behind the rock. Lastly, I added in a keetorange <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=93081b&name=Friends%20Accessories%20Beetle%20/%20Ladybug%20with%20Stud%20Holder&category=%5BFriends%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">beetle</a> (let’s just say it’s a crab) to create a triad and thus balance out the regular green and dark pink.</p>

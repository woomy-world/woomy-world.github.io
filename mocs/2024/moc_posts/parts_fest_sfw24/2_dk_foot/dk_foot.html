                    <p><i>This MOC is part of a series of MOCs built for New Elementary. A more in-depth analysis of the seed part used in this MOC can be found <a href="https://www.newelementary.com/2024/12/after-party-fest-nathan-dons-mocs.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</i></p>

                    <p>With this MOC, I once again focused on another tan seed part. Since it was used as the underbody of the dragon, I had quite a few options for the main color as tan was pretty neutral. I ended up going with a complementary color scheme of blue and orange, with orange being the accent. By having this as the accent, I was able to select both colors at the same saturation level, but still keep blue as the dominant color. However, I didn’t want blue to be <i>too</i> dominant, so I made the forearms and lower legs a neutral black. The layering of orange is then kept consistent with bigger splashes of orange (horns, wings) emerging from blue, while smaller bits of orange (claws) are layered over black.</p>

                    <p>When I had finished the dragon figure, I felt it needed some sort of weapon, mostly to balance the visual space created by the long tail. I decided to go with a bone as the weapon. I felt this made the most sense as the dragon was pretty primitive - it doesn’t have any armor to necessitate something like a sword. Finally, I created a base with a blocky style, inspired by Kevin’s (<a href="https://flic.kr/p/2q2mhw4" target="_blank">OptimusConvoy</a>) DEATH=ADDER base.</p>

                    <p>For the lawn mower, I focused on utilizing the shaping of the seed part as it reminded me of a handle bar. However, I felt that building a generic lawn mower would be boring, so I decided to give it some character. First, I gave the machine teeth using a similar technique to what was used in Burnout Incarnate. Once again, I chose to not have eyes but rather make the mouth more detailed. Furthermore, the red coloring of the machine along with the sharp shaping of the grass help convey a sense of anger from it. Lastly, I added a bit of posing to the wheels and set the build on an angle to give it life.</p>

                    <p>For the Bridge, I once again used the bar connection at the towball socket. This model initially started out as a simple build: two suspension supports and a block of dark-bluish gray asphalt between them. However, as I added more details such as the guard rails and dividing lines, the build became very System-math heavy. If you look closely at the pillars, you can see some of that math in action. As far as composition, I picked some bright, high saturation colors for the cars to pop against the rather neutral colors of the bridge.</p>

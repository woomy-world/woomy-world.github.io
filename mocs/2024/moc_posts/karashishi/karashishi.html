                    <p>My second published MOC for 2024. This creature is based on Chinese lion dogs; in fact, the name Karashishi translates to Chinese lion. However, I also drew inspiration from various creature designs, including Pok√©mon such as the legendary beasts (Entei, Raikou, and Suicune) as well as both forms of Growlithe and Arcanine.</p>

                    <p>The head was actually started about two years ago, but only as a tablescrap. I had paired up the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=24496pb02&idColor=1#T=S&C=1&O={%22color%22:1,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Ninjago Movie head wraps</a> with <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=30924&name=Minifigure,%20Utensil%20Bandage%20/%20Cast&category=%5BMinifigure,%20Utensil%5D#T=S&C=1&O={%22color%22:1,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Minifigure bandages</a> to create a muzzle, but it never really took off. I finally found a complementing piece in the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=67338&name=Croissant%20with%20Flat%20Ends&category=%5BFood%20&%20Drink%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">white croissants</a> as eyebrows, as all three (head wrap, bandage, croissant) share the same texture. The eyes are an iteration of the eyes for my Delibird moc; however, with the introduction of <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3386&name=Brick,%20Round%201%20x%201%20x%202/3%20Half%20Circle%20Extended%20with%20Side%20Stud&category=%5BBrick,%20Round%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">d-snot</a>, I was able to use the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=58176&name=Bar%20with%20Light%20Bulb%20Cover%20(Bionicle%20Barraki%20Eye)&category=%5BBar%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Barraki eye</a> in black as the pupil rather than a bar. The iris remains the same using a <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=15619&idColor=5#T=S&C=5&O={%22color%22:5,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Ninjago bandana</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=x264#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Technic rubber band</a>.</p>

                    <p>A lot of artwork for Chinese lion dogs feature cloud-like manes, and I wanted to make sure I replicated that texture. To do this, I used a combination of <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=P&catString=116" target="_blank">dishes</a>, <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=32474#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">voodoo balls</a>, <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2654#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">boatstuds</a>, and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=25214#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">macaroni</a>. As we move down the neck of the creature, the texture transitions to a more layered approach, which is accomplished with <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=27507#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">macaroni tiles</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=40379&name=Dinosaur%20Tail%20End%20Section%20/%20Horn&category=%5BAnimal,%20Body%20Part%5D#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">dino tails</a>. The addition of teal highlights is to complement the red and yellow, thus creating a triadic harmony.</p>

                    <p>For the underbody, I decided to wrap <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=65130#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Vidiyo bands</a> instead of brick-building it. Since these creatures tend to have smooth, organic underbodies, I felt it would be difficult and messy to capture that using traditional parts. Sure, I could have maybe flex-tube and system spammed a texture, but there would still be discrete gaps that are especially noticeable when working with a bright color like yellow. By using the flexible Vidiyo bands, I was able to create a continuous shape.</p>

                    <p>The limbs and upper body had me exploring new designs rather than relying on my go-to of CCBS shells. I even used the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=1686#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">newer shoulder armor piece</a> for the upper legs! Pretty much all of the limbs use system pieces, apart from the internal technic socket to attach them. The body makes use of <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=65473#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">maxaroni</a> and dino tails for shaping, and I followed the anatomy of lions and other beastly body types.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I created a display stand for the build. It consists of two separate parts, the rockwork and the plate. I deliberately spammed <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=47847#T=S&O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">rock panels</a> for the sharp, but not overdetailed, texture they provide. The sharp geometry of the rockwork contrasts between smooth, rounded shapes of the creature, yet complement it's angry expression as well. To add some variety to the ground, some of the panels are at a slight angle to look more natural. Finally, the entire assembly is offset at an angle from the plate. I took the added liberty of doing a bunch of system math to make it so that this thing is easily collapsible and transportable.</p>

                    <p>Honestly, this might be my favorite build I've made. It really feels like a culmination of previous MOCs, yet also introduced challenges and techniques that I hadn't attempted before. I hope to continue this momentum in future builds this year.</p>

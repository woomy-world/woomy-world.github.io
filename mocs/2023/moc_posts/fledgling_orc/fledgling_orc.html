                    <p>This MOC was built for the Jordan's (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188485803@N06/" target="_blank">dan.ko</a>) Orctober contest! As the name implies, the contest brief was to build an orc.</p>
                    <p>I will admit, I may have had this build started prior to the contest announcement... but it was a very tiny tablescrap at the time. Essentially, I had only the jaw assembly created as I was inspired by, well, the minifigure orc jaw (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2576pb01&idColor=155#T=S&C=155&O={%22color%22:155,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">2576pb01</a>) from the CMF series 24. By using the two of those to create the mouth, I thought it gave an interesting, non-Lego appearance. However, after creating that assembly, I placed it in the tablescrap box, as olive green is a pretty difficult color for character building. Luckily this contest was just the spark I needed to revisit this tablescrap and turn it into a complete build.</p>
                    <p>With the scale of the MOC essentially decided by the tablescrap jaw, I decided to run with it and create a tiny orc. I thought it would be a funny idea to make a child orc that was trying to be mean. To obtain that cute yet angry look, I wanted large, solid color eyes. My first thought was to use ball joints as the eyes; however, these were a bit too big. Furthermore, I typically like to have a bit of an outline around the eye to make it pop, especially if it's the focal point. So instead, I took a deep dive into the minifigure headgear catalog on Bricklink, and found a hidden gem: the Queen's tiara (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3305pb01&idColor=115#T=S&C=115&O={%22color%22:115,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">3305pb01</a>). Shout out to whoever photographed it on Bricklink, it was the perfect picture for me to invision the perfect eye for my little orc.</p>

                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>Continuing with the cute but angry look, I went with big, long arms with a tiny torso, sort of like Tinkatuff and Tinkaton from Pok√©mon. The orc also carries a club; I had debated going with a more realistic skull club using Ninjago skulls, but the classic smiling skeleton minifigure heads were too funny and iconic to not use. Lastly, the base compliments the orc's short, child-like character by giving him something to stand on to appear tall and 'grown-up'.</p>

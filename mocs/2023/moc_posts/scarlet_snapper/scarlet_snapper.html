                    <p>It's near the end of the year, which means it's time to get a head start on 2024. The collaborative, themed build for BIONILUG in 2024 is "Horror Garden"! Members have the opportunity to build plants, tourists, and/or scenery, and I chose to make a carnivorous plant.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/wip_1.jpg"> 
                <div class="text_body">
                     <p>I started this build by messing around with the Xplode armor parts. I figured they would make a good mouth/head, but the challenge would be trying to work around it's single axle connection.                   
                </div>           
                <img src="images/wip_2.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>In order to give myself more connection points, I created a sub-assembly using an inverted 2x2 curved slope and 1x2 modified plate with clips. There's just enough friction that it fits without falling out. This sub-assembly provided four more studs, which given this tiny space, is a lot. From here, I could branch off with bar and clip connections.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/wip_3.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>To finish off the head, I wanted to add a few leaves. I initially tried to use pterodactyl wings; however, they were way too big. In addition, the rounded edges of the wings did not compliment the spiky, aggressive nature of the rest of the head. So instead, I used IFB spikes in combination with a palm tree leaf. The sharp geometry of these parts work together with the spiky teeth of the Xplode parts to create an aggressive, angry look.

                <img src="images/wip_4.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>Next, I started working on the stem. The head was a lot bigger than anticipated, so I had to make a stem to accomodate the size. I first made a CCBS skeleton with the plan to wrap maxaroni and dino tails around it. However, the skeleton was too thick. Therefore, I changed the skeleton to use maxaroni and technic axles. With a thinner frame, I was able to more easily wrap the tails around. In addition, I used a combination of similarly textured parts such as ziplines to fill in gaps between the dino tails.</p>

                <img src="images/wip_5.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>Lastly, I had to create a base. I placed the stem on a modified version of the base from "Tenebrae Blossomwood" and realized that I needed to place the stem at an angle so that the head would be looking down (rather than staring straight). I then added some vines/arms. However, there was starting to be too much black at the base, which made the model a bit messy.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/wip_6.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>I decided to break up the black by adding in some dark red. The dark red is restricted to smooth, circular shapes, which provides a different texture to the vine-like texture of black pieces. This was also the perfect opportunity to take advantage of the gradient provided by the Kalmah head pieces from Bionicle. It is BIONILUG after all, so what better way than to use some G1 parts!</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/wip_7.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>At this point, the plant was mostly finished, but I wanted to provide a better transition between the plant and the base. I decided to add in some olive green sprouts. Due to their muted color, it doesn't draw attention away from the brightness of the head - the focal point of the build.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/wip_8.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>Finally, I changed the base color to reddish brown. Ideally, I wanted to use dark brown, but I have very few parts in that color.There was also a bit too much brown initially, so I replaced the BURP with a Bohrok shield instead.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="images/scarlet_snapper.jpg">
                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>And here's the final model! I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, and it was good practice for trying to express character without a typical head. Having to rely on the geometry of certain elements of the build to convey the character of the plant was a challenging but rewarding experience.

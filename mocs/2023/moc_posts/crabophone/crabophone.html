                    <p>After the stress and intensity of Bio-Cup, I needed a relaxing project. The idea of a gramophone crab had been in my backlog of ideas for a while, so I decided now would be the time to do it. Furthermore, due to the more abstract subject of this build, I didn't have to strictly adhere to any anatomical details.</p>
                    <p>While it may look simple, there's quite a bit of Technic and System SNOT interactions going on internally to get the curved box shape. Furthermore, the tiling that sits on the top of the box is a scaled down version of the shape of the box - getting all this while having an indent to connect the CD was quite the brain twister. And yes, the CD is a Bionicle CD from one of the 2003 Rahkshi sets!</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I do want to talk about the gramophone horn a bit. It uses two types of Ninjago spinners (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=50663pb09#T=S&C=115&O={%22color%22:115,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">50663pb09</a> and <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=69784pb01#T=S&C=42&O={%22color%22:42,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">69784pb01</a>). At this scale, there isn't really any concave cone-like part, in a solid color, and a brick-built version would be too texturally busy. I think the solution I used here is okay. Not the best, but it does take advantage of the dual molding of the gold and glitter trans-clear spinner. The second medium blue and trans-yellow spinner provides the horn flare shaping, and while the color is definitely not natural, I think it does help give the model a more fantastical and whimsical appearance.</p>

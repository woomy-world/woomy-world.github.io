                    <p>This was a quick build for the Sonic Eggman takeover contest that was on Lego Ideas in July. Honestly, I initially had no plans to enter. I was playing around with the pink frogs from the Bonsai Tree 10281, when I noticed that the part looked exactly like Eggman's nose. Additionally, I had recently bought a duplicate Turkey Costume minifigure from CMF series 23, and noticed that the wings made an excellent mustache. I whipped up a head and was left with a big "now what?".</p>
                    <p>Since robotic enemies tend to be a thing in Sonic games, I settled on the idea of Eggman creating a Sonic lookalike mech, but with Eggman's face instead. For such a small build, there are some fun textural elements going on. Both of the weapons have angular red casing, with a slight offset and reduction in size for the gold endings. Furthermore, the flat silver pieces all represent machinery; thus they all have similar greebly textures. Lastly, I took advantage of the Penguin Mario cap's (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=73733pb01&name=Large%20Figure%20Headgear,%20Super%20Mario%20Cap%20with%20Molded%20Yellow%20Bill%20Pattern%20(Penguin%20Mario)&category=%5BLarge%20Figure%20Part%5D#T=S&C=7&O={%22color%22:7,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">73733pb01</a>) dual molding and used the yellow portion, in conjunction with yellow dino tails, as the lining of the jacket.</p>

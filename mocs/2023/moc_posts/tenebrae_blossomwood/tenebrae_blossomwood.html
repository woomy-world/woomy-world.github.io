                    <p>For 2023, the BIONILUG collab theme was High Fantasy! Since I was away for college, I couldn't fully participate; however, I cranked out this scenery piece during spring break.</p>
                    <p>A week is not a whole lot of time for a build, so I decided to work in black for the tree. The part selection in black, especially for character/creature building, is considerably large, which made the build easier for my limited time frame - but that doesn't mean there isn't an opportunity for some NPU! One of my favorite reasons for building Constraction is the reliance on the shapes of larger parts rather than using smaller System pieces to create a shape. For the tree trunk, a Death Trooper helmet (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=26911c01pb01&name=Large%20Figure%20Head%20Modified%20SW%20Death%20Trooper%20with%20Dark%20Green%20Core%20and%20Lime%20Circles%20Pattern&category=%5BLarge%20Figure%20Part%5D#T=S&C=11&O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">26911c01pb01</a>) is used along with a CCBS shin piece (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=21562&idColor=11#T=S&C=11&O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">21562</a>). The front of the helmet has a slightly concave shape, which allows it to flow with the shin. However, even with the shin, the green visor was still somewhat visible. To obscure this portion, I used a dino tail. This ended up introducing a bit of texture not visible elsewhere on the neighboring CCBS parts, so by adding in a zipline and elephant trunk around the helmet, the dino tail would not stand out as much.</p>
                    <p>The base also has some fun texturing detail. I'm particularly hpapy with the use of the CCBS foot (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=90661&idColor=11#T=S&C=11&O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">90661</a>) combined with the 4x4 fractured wedge (<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=64867&name=Wedge%204%20x%204%20Fractured%20Polygon%20Top&category=%5BWedge%5D#T=S&C=85&O={%22color%22:%2285%22,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">64867</a>). Once again, by obscuring part of a piece - this time, the socket portion of the CCBS foot - I could exploit the texture of the front of the piece, which matches the rocky look of the fractured wedge. Lastly, I added in some spring green eggs to compliment the lavender color.
